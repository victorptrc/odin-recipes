      <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons neutral oil, divided</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon minced ginger</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper, plus more for garnish to taste</li>
      <li>8 ounces uncooked linguine pasta</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons sesame seeds</li>
      <li>3 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season chicken with garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper. Whisk
        together 1 1/2 cups water with soy sauce and vinegar in a 2 cup
        measuring cup or bowl. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add
        chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until browned on all sides
        (Chicken will not be cooked through at this point). Remove chicken from
        skillet and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add remaining neutral oil and sesame oil to skillet. Add garlic and
          ginger and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute, stirring constantly.
          Stir in crushed red pepper. Add pasta and stir to coat in garlic
          mixture. Add reserved soy sauce mixture and stir until everything is
          well incorporated, scraping any browned bits from bottom of skillet.
          Bring mixture to a boil and reduce to simmer.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Add chicken and any accumulated juices into skillet along with brown
        sugar. Stir and cook, stirring occasionally, until pasta is cooked and
        sauce is thickened, 10 to 12 minutes. Add additional water as needed to
        keep mixture saucy until pasta is cooked. Stir in green onions, sesame
        seeds and more crushed red pepper if desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
