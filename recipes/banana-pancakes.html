    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Turn overripe, blackened bananas into sweet and fluffy American-style
      pancakes. Serve with syrup and crunchy, toasted pecan nuts as a delicious
      brunch treat
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="center">
      <li>350g self-raising flour</li>
      <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>2 very ripe bananas</li>
      <li>2 medium eggs</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>250ml whole milk</li>
      <li>butter, for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="center">
      <li>
        Sieve the flour, baking powder and a generous pinch of salt into a large
        bowl. In a separate mixing bowl, mash the very ripe bananas with a fork
        until smooth, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla extract and milk. Make a
        well in the centre of the dry ingredients, tip in the wet ingredients
        and swiftly whisk together to create a smooth, silky batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a little knob of butter in a large non-stick pan over a medium
        heat. Add 2-3 tbsp of the batter to the pan and cook for several
        minutes, or until small bubbles start appearing on the surface. Flip the
        pancake over and cook for 1-2 mins on the other side. Repeat with the
        remaining batter, keeping the pancakes warm in a low oven.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stack the pancakes on plates and top with the banana slices, a glug of
        sticky maple syrup and a handful of pecan nuts, if you like.
      </li>
